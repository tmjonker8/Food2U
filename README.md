## Description

This is the web app for a fictional company called "Food2u".  Food2u is a company that is similar to doordash or grubhub that allows customers to browse restaurants
in their area and then allows them to submit orders to that restaurant for pickup or delivery.  I'm working on this to learn more about HTML, CSS, Javascript and Springboot.
The front-end is made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and Thymeleaf.  Back-end is Java Spring Boot with Spring Security.
